# Understanding Features
Will just try to understand what are features, why are they important, why corners are important etc.

Features are regions of images with variation. Like the corners of a image.
* [Features](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_feature2d/py_features_meaning/py_features_meaning.html)
# Harris Corner Detection
Will understand the concepts behind Harris Corner Detection.
We will see the functions: **cv2.cornerHarris(), cv2.cornerSubPix().**
* [Harris Corner Detection](01_HarrisDetection.py)
# Shi-Tomasi Corner Detector
Will learn about the another corner detector: Shi-Tomasi Corner Detector
We will see the function: **cv2.goodFeaturesToTrack().**<br>
###### This function is more appropriate for tracking
* [Shi-Tomasi Detector](02_ShiTomasi.py)
# Scale-Invariant Feature Transform
Will learn about the concepts of SIFT algorithm
We will learn to find SIFT Keypoints and Descriptors.
* [SIFT](.py)
