# Contours : Getting Started
## What are contours?
Contours can be explained simply as a curve joining all the continuous points (along the boundary), having same color or intensity. The contours are a useful tool for shape analysis and object detection and recognition.
* For better accuracy, use binary images. So before finding contours, apply threshold or canny edge detection.
