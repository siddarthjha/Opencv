# Basic Operations on Images
* Access pixel values and modify them
* Access image properties
* Setting Region of Image (ROI)
* Splitting and Merging images

Almost all the operations in this section is mainly related to Numpy rather than OpenCV. A good knowledge of Numpy is required to write better optimized code with OpenCV
