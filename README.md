# Opencv
OpenCV-Python is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems.

The code is mainly focused on OpenCV 3.x version (although most of them will also work with OpenCV 2.x).

# Installing OpenCV from prebuilt binaries
1. Below Python packages are to be downloaded and installed to their default locations.
  * Python 3.x (3.4+) or Python 2.7.x from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
  * Numpy package (for example, using **pip install numpy** command).
  * Matplotlib (**pip install matplotlib**).
2. Install all packages into their default locations. Python will be installed to C:/Python27/ in case of Python 2.7.
3. After installation, open Python IDLE. Enter import numpy and make sure Numpy is working fine.
4. Download latest OpenCV release from [GitHub](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases) or [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/) site and double-click to extract it.
5. Goto opencv/build/python/2.7 folder.
6. Copy cv2.pyd to C:/Python27/lib/site-packages.
7. Open Python IDLE and type following codes in Python terminal
